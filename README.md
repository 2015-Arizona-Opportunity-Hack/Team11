Problem Statement:
ICAN Arizona's current communication system with its members is unreliable and inefficient. What we're aiming to do
with this project is to create an application that will allow the administration of the NPO to send push notifications
to parents when they need to alert parents/members with urgent information, while the non-urgent information can also be
displayed inside the application as well.
